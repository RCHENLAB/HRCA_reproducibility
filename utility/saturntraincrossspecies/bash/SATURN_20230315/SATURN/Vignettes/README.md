# Vignettes

This directory contains notebooks and extra data files for replicating SPEAR results and figures.

For a general vignette on running SPEAR, checkout `frog_zebrafish_embryogenesis/Train SATURN.ipynb`

For each integration you will need to run through the corrsponding `*dataloader.ipynb` first. This will require downloading large raw data files.

To fully replicate results you will need to run SPEAR 30 times for both frog/zebrafish embryogenesis and the 5 species AH atlas. This will generate many large files.
