# HRCA_reproducibility

This repository comprises code and analyses for the Human Retina Cell Atlas (HRCA) project within the HCA framework, emphasizing the [Eye Biological Network](https://www.humancellatlas.org/biological-networks/).

## File organization for figures and tables

The main code can be found in the [analysis](./analysis) directory of this repository. The subdirectories are organized according to the main figures corresponding to the manuscript. Each figure folder contains a document file that explains the running script, input, and output files. The [utility](./utility) folder comprises standalone scripts that have been used in multiple places.

The repositories below are also developed and utilized in the HRCA.

1. The pipeline to process the unpublished and collected public datasets is accessible at https://github.com/lijinbio/cellqc

2. Scripts related to the benchmark study, integration pipeline, and label transfer using scArches are available at https://github.com/theislab/HRCA-reproducibility
